A simple 2048 AI written in C.

All of this is just me getting back in to learning C again, yes it is hacky and
really probably pretty aweful. Almost 0 comments doesn't really do much to
improve it.

I initially wrote a terrible AI (literally it spammed LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP), but
to get things rolling I have used ov3y's AI. I have tweaked things, during
translation from JavaScript to C I have probably broken a few things. :D

Seriously checkout ov3y's AI, it is really well done.
